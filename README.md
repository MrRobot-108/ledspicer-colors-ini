# ledspicer-colors-ini
This repository contains the files colors.ini and controls.ini used by ledspicer as color database for arcade games.

## colors.ini
Colors.ini (starting with a capital letter) was originally created by headkaze and updated by kpshek. It has been used as the basis for other similar color configuration files/utilities.
I used this file as the basis for my own colors.ini file.
The base file from kpshek had 1422 roms included, mine has 2773 for the first version (VERSION 03/30/24). The format is slightly different, I generated a new one.
Most additional entries refer to information from the website http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/, some come from users Kjell and SK360 (THX!).

## controls.ini
controls.ini only contains information necessary for ledspicer and has nothing to do with the ledblinky file Controls.ini. 
It contains all the roms that can also be found in colors.ini.

## ledspicer.ini
This is a new file format that is intended to replace controls.ini and colors.ini in newer ledspicer versions. 
It contains the same information as colors.in and controls.ini.
