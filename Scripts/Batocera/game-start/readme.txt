you will need at least ledspicer V 0.6.0 for these scripts
copy game-start directory to /userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/scripts (or /system/configs/emulationstation/scripts via SMB)

you have to make the script executeable:
1. open ssh connection
2. start "chmod +x /userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/scripts/game-start/game-start.sh"
